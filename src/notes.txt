The tweets slice of the state in the store will be modified by actions that go through the tweets reducer. 
The users slice of the state in the store will be modified by actions that go through the users reducer. 
And, similarly, the authedUser portion of the state in the store will be modified by actions that go through the authedUser reducer.

The STORE:
-TWEETS - 
-USERS - 
-AUTHEDUSER - the result of an authedUser action going through its authedUser reducer

We need to invoke the :
getInitialData() from api.js so we can get the initial getInitialData
It returns a promise(async) so we need to use redux thunk

authedUser prop on the store is there, so when we like a tweet or make a new tweet we know who did these actions in the app
we will set it as AUTHED_ID

4.Create Store in root of our app by passing in root reducer, and wrapp App component with Provider
5.Pass the store down as prop to the Provider
6.
